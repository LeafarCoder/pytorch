// This struct defines caches of descriptor pools, and descriptor sets allocated
// from those pools, both intended to minimize redundant object reconstructions
// at the cost of extra memory consumption.
//
// A desciprotr set is effectively a table of pointers / handles that tells the
// core executing the shader where in (GPU or GPU-accessible system) memory the
// resources (i.e. buffers and images) it interacts with reside.  These tables,
// henceforth referred to as descriptor sets as Vulkan calls them, are re-created
// continuously in a frame as the resources they point to move around in memory.
//
// To accelerate creation of the descriptor sets, modern graphics APIs allocate
// them from a pool, more elaborately referred to as descriptor pools, which do
// need to be purged frequently _after_ none of the descriptors the pools contain
// is in use by the GPU.  Care must be taken that descriptors are not freed while
// they are in use by the pipeline.
//
// As you can imagine, it is possible to have multiple descriptor pools, each of
// which configured to house different types of descriptor sets with different
// allocation strategies. These descriptor pools themselves are fairly stable
// objects in that they theymself should not be created and destroyed frequently.
// That is the reason why we store them in a cache, which according to our usage
// of the term cache in this implementatoin, is reserved for objects that are
// created infrequently and stabilize to a very manageable number quickly over
// the lifetime of the program.
//
// Descriptor sets though, on the other hand, are allocated from pools
// frequently, which indeed does mean that the pools must be purged on a regular
// basis or else they will run out of free items.  Again, this is in line with
// our usage of the term pool in this implementation which we use to refer to a
// container of objects that are required to be purged once per frame.
//
// It is important to point out that for performance reasons, we intentionally
// do not free the descriptor sets individually, and instead opt to purge the
// cache in its totality once per frame, even though Vulkan supports the former
// usage pattern as well.  This is by design.
